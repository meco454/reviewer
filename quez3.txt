are computer algorithms that use data to make estimations (educated guesses) or decisions.
When normal computer software needs to be improved, people ______ itIn the Boots That Fit Scenario, you own a shop that sells _________ for avalanche-rescue dogs
In the BTF Scenario, you own a shop that sells harnesses for ____________
A machine learning algorithm uses _____ to get better at a specific task
A ____________ uses data to get better at a specific task
Customers all seem to pick the correct harness sizes but are constantly ordering doggy ______ that are the wrong size. 
 you could approximate which doggy boots are the correct size, depending on the ______ chosen
 is the core component of machine learning, and ultimately what we are trying to build.
 might estimate how old a person is from a photo, predict what you might like to see on social media, or decide where a robotic arm should move to.
machine learning models are shaped by _________
models learn from?
Note that harness size and dog boot size are data; they are not part of the model. 
What is our input in BTF?What is our output in BTF?
are discovered during training
 are not selected by the human designer
 Instead, parameter values are set to an initial guess, and then adjusted during an automated learning process called
As you can see, we have the sizes of boots and harnesses for _____ avalanche dogs.
We're just getting started, so we will start with a very simple model called ______. This is just a straight line
OLS means?
OLS is just a straight line, sometimes called?
what do we import for ols?
forumla for model thingy?
formula for BTF?
OLS model assignment thingy?
OLS models have two parameters, what are they? 
We need to train (_______) our model to find these values (parameters) so that the model can reliably estimate dogs' boot size based on their harness size.
The goal of _______ is to improve a model so that it can make high-quality estimations or predictions. 
Models don't train themselves, they're trained using data plus two pieces of code: the _________, and the optimizer.
Models don't train themselves, they're trained using data plus two pieces of code: the objective function, and the ___________.
 is what we want to the model to be able to do
So that a computer can understand our objective, we need to provide our goal as code snippet called an?
they judge whether the model is doing a good job (estimating boot size well) or bad job (estimating boot size badly).
refers to the information that we provide the model with
data is also known as? also refers to information that the objective function might need
During training, the model makes a prediction, and the _________ calculates how well it performed
The _______ is code that then changes the model's parameters so the model will do a better job next time.
The optimizer is code that then changes the model's ________ so the model will do a better job next time.
dataset = pandas._________('doggy-boot-harness.csv')
_____ dataset["sex"] to delete row sex?
________ a model means providing inputs and receiving an estimation or prediction.
_______ a model is the process of improving how well a model works
requires that we use the model, as well as the objective function and optimizer, in a special loop
Usually, we only train a model how many times?.
When we use our model, we only need the column(s) of data that the model accepts as input. These columns are called
During training, the objective function usually needs to know both the model's output and what the correct answer was. These are called
import _______ ______.dump(model,model_filename)
joblib._____(model, model_filename)
3 algorithms for Clustering?
2 algorithms for Classifcation
In the Elk Farm Case Scenario, what is the Feature?
In the Elk Farm Case Scenaio, what is the Label?
What is the angle of the line
What moves the line up or down
