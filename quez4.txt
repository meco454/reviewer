 This approach is effective but lacks of generality.
  It is well suited for applications using regular structures, and therefore its applicability is valid for a limited set of problems.

Upon mismatch, the program jumps to an error handler that will cause the program to restart.
has high error coverage at the cost of performance penalty due to time redundancy as introduced into the system.
Since we use general purpose registers as shadow registers, more register spilling occurs with _______.
More spilling causes more performance overhead since it increases the number of memory operations.
EDAC means?
e.g., Cyclic Redundancy Checks or CRC, Hamming Codes, Bose-Chaudhuri- Hocquenghem or BCH etc
are effective in error detection but they suffer from very high time overhead.
However, there is a limitation when it comes to code lengths. These conventional error correcting codes namely, They have limitations and there exists very high time redundancy when they are implemented by software.
When the check-bits become erroneous, the stored check bits do not match the computation and as a result, a block code fails. In general, checksum schemes fail when they are corrupted enough to transform to another valid code work (the distance of the code).
This approach relies on periodic reloading of code on main memory from an immutable memory. 
This is effective for protecting the code segment of Operating system and application programs
Performance penalty is due to repetitive memory reading.
This approach means running an application in the presence of faults. 
Few processors are used to run the same program and vote to identify errors in any single processor.
Errors can be masked from application software.
No software rollbacks are required to fix errors.
This means removing failed modules from the system.
When failure occurs in a module, its effects on the remaining portion of the system is isolated.

This ensures reliability but is expensive in terms of hardware or runtime cost. 
The idea is to take a majority vote on a calculation replicated N times.

  Any even number of single bit-errors remains undetected.
   By using typical checksums for each row and column in a matrix, we can detect erroneous element of a matrix. 
This is useful for detecting errors in application data.
This approach is useful for detecting and correcting multiple bits errors in data words. 
Even all bits errors in a data word are corrected by this approach.
 This is useful for detecting transient errors or soft-errors in microprocessor registers, memory and stack area that might occur during the operational time at various industrial environments. 
This generalized approach does not need multiple processors and multiple software design.
This is a single - version low-cost but an efficient (fast and having low memory-space overhead) approach for tolerating transient faults.
