The number one cause of software failure is ________ in application programming
The number one cause of software failure is human error in __________
This failure happens during the coding process, often due to oversights in the software development lifecycle.
when a programmer accidentally uses a "greater than" sign rather than a "less than" sign in their code.
Techniques for staying on top of software malfunction: 1.
Techniques for staying on top of software malfunction: 2.
Techniques for staying on top of software malfunction: 3.
having a quality _______ on staff gives you a huge advantage when it comes to catching and correcting software errors.
Your ____________ can perform tests and monitor your system at the code level.
The right __________ can be a huge asset to your business, providing scheduled routine maintenance, backup services and expert support if you ever do experience a malfunction.
Invest time and money into ________ and implementation
Invest time and money into development and __________

The US Department of Commerce’s National Institute of Standards and Technology concluded that __________  were so common and damaging that they cost the American economy an estimated $59 billion every year.
ABFT means?
 refers to a self-contained method for detecting, locating, and correcting faults with a software procedure. 
 It exploits the structure of numerical operations.
 This approach is effective but lacks of generality.
  It is well suited for applications using regular structures, and therefore its applicability is valid for a limited set of problems.
  the logic statements inserted at different points in the program
  reflect invariant relationships between the variables of the program and they often lead to various problems as assertions are not transparent to a programmer and their effectiveness depends on the nature of an application and on a programmer's ability.
CFC means?
The basic task of ______ is to partition an application program in basic blocks or the branch-free parts of code. 
A deterministic signature (or number) is assigned to each block and faults are detected by comparing the run-time signature with a pre-computed one
In CFC, A deterministic _______ (or number) is assigned to each block and faults are detected by comparing the run-time signature with a pre-computed one
In most ____ techniques one of the major problems is to tune the test granularity that should be used.
In most CFC techniques one of the major problems is to tune the test ______ that should be used.
PD means? 
The programmer decides to duplicate the most critical procedures and to compare the obtained results on executing the procedures on two different processors.
The programmer decides to duplicate the most critical procedures and to compare the obtained results on executing the procedures on two different ________
This approach requires a programmer to decide which procedures to be duplicated and to introduce proper checking on the results
These code modifications are done manually and might introduce errors.
Code duplication for byte-error detection by a single processor.
EDDI means?
Computation results from master and shadow instructions are compared before writing to memory.
Upon mismatch, the program jumps to an error handler that will cause the program to restart.
has high error coverage at the cost of performance penalty due to time redundancy as introduced into the system.
Since we use general purpose registers as shadow registers, more register spilling occurs with _______.
More spilling causes more performance overhead since it increases the number of memory operations.
